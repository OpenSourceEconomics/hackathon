# Welcome to [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)!

These slides are directly based on the slidev example, I just edited a couple of pages. To start the slide show, (install Node.js) and then:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- visit http://localhost:3030

Edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes.

Learn more about Slidev on [documentations](https://sli.dev/).
