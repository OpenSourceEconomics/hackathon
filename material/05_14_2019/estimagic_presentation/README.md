## Disclaimer

estimagic is in pre-alpha stage and should not yet be used.


## Instructions


To run the notebooks you have to create a conda environment first. Here are the steps:

- open a Terminal in the directory of the `environment.yml` file
- type: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- type: `conda activate estimagic_presentation`
- type: `jupyter notebook`

When you run any code that opens a dashboard, you have to restart the kernel of that notebook before you can run any other code that opens a dashboard. This will be improved in future versions of estimagic.
